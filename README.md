# Ticketing-System

This my first full stack project. This is a Ticketing System that allows users to raise tickets with different priorities and ticket-types. This web app also has dashboards for user and admin roles where admins gets automatic email-notifications about new tickets and to resolve tickets that are already open with intervals of time. The user gets updated regularly about the status of their tickets raised.
